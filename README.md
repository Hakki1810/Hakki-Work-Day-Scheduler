# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

A calendar application that allows the user to save his/her events into each time block found on the website. In addition, the user is able to save this information into the local storage found in the website. This website uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## What have we done

1. When I open the planner then the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
2. When I scroll down then I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
3. When I view the time blocks for that day then each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
4. When I click into a time block then I can enter an event
5. When I click the save button for that time block then the text for that event is saved in local storage
6. When I refresh the page then the saved events persist
